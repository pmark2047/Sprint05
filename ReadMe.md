## Overview

**Weather Map of Idaho and Capital Cities**:

**Python Code that will gather information through the WeatherMapAPI and display it on a map through a generated website**:

**Project Goals**:

## Instructions for Build and Use

Steps to build and/or run the software:

1. Get a free subscription at openweathermap.org and generate an API key
2. Create a python file named Key.py which declares your personal api_key and put it in the same folder as the WeatherMap.py file
3. Run the python file
4. Open the HTML site that's generated

Instructions for using the software:

1. Navigate to a city you'd like to see
2. Click on the weather icon marker
3. Details will readily be available to read

## Development Environment 

To recreate the development environment, you need the following software and/or libraries with the specified versions:

* VS Code
* a WeatherMap API key
* Get live server installed on VS code to run the HTML

## Useful Websites to Learn More

I found these websites useful in developing this software:

* openweathermap.org

## Future Work

The following items I plan to fix, improve, and/or add to this project in the future:

* [ ] If i continued this project, I'd want the calls to be live rather than pretermined from
  running the python file. I'd like to be able to click on any city on the map, and the api call could quickly be made
